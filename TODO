TODO

* [COMPAT:] Check Rails 3 compatibility.

* [BUG:] link "+", @post failed

* [BUG:] XSS-issue with labels. (NOTE: Needs more details when this happen, could not reproduce in integration test)

* [FEATURE:] Fix action mapping procs to handle named scopes. Should work, but do not for some reason. =/

* [FEATURE:] Fix action mapping procs to receive session, params, etc in a options hash. My mocking/stubbing don't want to work. ='(

* [TEST:] Integration tests for namespaced controllers/models

* [DESIGN:] Link2::Brain#link_to_args should maybe be split into multiple methods when API is settled.

* [DESIGN:] Merge #label_and_url_for_resource and #url_for_args

* [ENHANCEMENT:] Check with Rails routes (RouteSet) if current action is a :member or :collection:

    link(:show)   =>  link(:show, @post)
    link(:index)  =>  link(:index, Post)

NOT SURE:

* [TEST:] ORM-tests: DataMapper, MongoMapper

* Make Link2 parse label and title-attribute for the link based on configuration: Link2.label_method = :to_s, Link2.attr_methods = {:title => :description}

* This works:
    link_to x, :terms   =>  link_to x, terms_path

  So maybe this should work the same?:
   link :terms   =>  link :terms, terms_pat  ( <=>  link :terms, :terms )

  The middle part (auto-detect route for :fraggle before resource :fraggle) maybe too abstract DSL, not sure.
